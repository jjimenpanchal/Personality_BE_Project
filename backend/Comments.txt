Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

That kiss makes the song more interesting?
I would always like this song?
i sang this song with my old bestfriend in 3rd grade. man it was so funn
I sat beside my crush 4 years ago on the back of the van when we went swimming before summer Vaca started. That's where we started going out. Things did go well but after summer vacation, she started avoiding me. My friends told me that I have to stay away from her for my own good. I should've listened. When a snitch friend of mine told me that she MADE OUT  with my cousin, I just dropped. Trying so hard to suck those tears in. I realized that they were pushing me away from her to save my feelings. I got so drunk after that. Then I thought about taking my own life to end the pain. Then I went to the top of the mountain 1000 meters up. It is where my mom and dad were buried. And said my problems while crying. Then I felt asleep. Next thing I know, I was seeing my dead parents comforting me and saying "it's all right. Cry as much as you want. Me?". Then I went to school the next day, changed my personality, appearance, and attitude. I became more serious, more pumped, and an asshole. I pretty much don't give a s**t at everything. I don't care if they say someone f*CKEd your SOON to be girlfriend, I don't care if I get hurt, I didn't care if she apologize. The person I was back isn't what they were seeing now.
2016 was great

My one of the favourite and memorable song.
My caller tune since 4 four years
Is anyone listening to this legend in 2021?
When this song came out:
TikTok was a song
Corona was a beer

Good times

Who left who? They both say they're left.
0:41
Anyone from srilanka?  ?
Who is gonna listen to this even in 2021?? Damn its addictive
Yes dude I'm in 2021?


Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

I would always like this song?
i sang this song with my old bestfriend in 3rd grade. man it was so funn
I sat beside my crush 4 years ago on the back of the van when we went swimming before summer Vaca started. That's where we started going out. Things did go well but after summer vacation, she started avoiding me. My friends told me that I have to stay away from her for my own good. I should've listened. When a snitch friend of mine told me that she MADE OUT  with my cousin, I just dropped. Trying so hard to suck those tears in. I realized that they were pushing me away from her to save my feelings. I got so drunk after that. Then I thought about taking my own life to end the pain. Then I went to the top of the mountain 1000 meters up. It is where my mom and dad were buried. And said my problems while crying. Then I felt asleep. Next thing I know, I was seeing my dead parents comforting me and saying "it's all right. Cry as much as you want. Me?". Then I went to school the next day, changed my personality, appearance, and attitude. I became more serious, more pumped, and an asshole. I pretty much don't give a s**t at everything. I don't care if they say someone f*CKEd your SOON to be girlfriend, I don't care if I get hurt, I didn't care if she apologize. The person I was back isn't what they were seeing now.
2016 was great

My caller tune since 4 four years
Is anyone listening to this legend in 2021?
When this song came out:

Anyone from srilanka?  ?
Who is gonna listen to this even in 2021?? Damn its addictive
Yes dude I'm in 2021?


Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay?

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older (no, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (no, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (no, we ain't ever getting older)

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

My fav ????
Me listening to this: "Oh! This is one of that catchy songs that I keep hearing on radio but I never know the name of"

When I say I keep hearing it, that was when it still air on radio
me and my crush/best friend haven't talked for 4 years and this used to be our song.
It reminds me of a time when people and things i loved were still within my grasp.
