Leaving a comment so I get reminded of this song every so often
I was a college fresher back in 2016. Me and my friends used to listen to this while drinking and getting high, having fun. But now, we have all graduated and departed in separate ways and never seen each other again anymore. I used to listen to this song everytime i miss my friends. Although we talk to each others on phone, its not like how we used to be back in the day. I miss my guys! ?
Dear parents, just because your child is smiling at their phone, doesn't mean they have boyfriend or girlfriend, they are just watching this masterpiece!

You know what's heartbreaking? Making magazine page women the goal and not a real person.
She never counts and he doesn't know why things don't work.
Whatever happened to getting to know someone and going with your gut because you trained yourself to want reality and human mistakes and flaws and broken trying diverse definitions of what makes sense based on all the things that have happened to us that make us who we are

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and

Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

Wow
i searched this up just to dislike it
Buatuful song
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

I would always like this song?
i sang this song with my old bestfriend in 3rd grade. man it was so funn
I sat beside my crush 4 years ago on the back of the van when we went swimming before summer Vaca started. That's where we started going out. Things did go well but after summer vacation, she started avoiding me. My friends told me that I have to stay away from her for my own good. I should've listened. When a snitch friend of mine told me that she MADE OUT  with my cousin, I just dropped. Trying so hard to suck those tears in. I realized that they were pushing me away from her to save my feelings. I got so drunk after that. Then I thought about taking my own life to end the pain. Then I went to the top of the mountain 1000 meters up. It is where my mom and dad were buried. And said my problems while crying. Then I felt asleep. Next thing I know, I was seeing my dead parents comforting me and saying "it's all right. Cry as much as you want. Me?". Then I went to school the next day, changed my personality, appearance, and attitude. I became more serious, more pumped, and an asshole. I pretty much don't give a s**t at everything. I don't care if they say someone f*CKEd your SOON to be girlfriend, I don't care if I get hurt, I didn't care if she apologize. The person I was back isn't what they were seeing now.
2016 was great

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
